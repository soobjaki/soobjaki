### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- I am studying Computer Engineering at University of Balamand. 
I am a dedicated volunteer and active community member, with a passion for empowering the younger generation and fostering community growth.
Currently, I volunteer with Ruwwad Al Tanmiah, where I engage in activities that equip children, youth, and the community with essential life skills while ensuring they have moments of enjoyment. 
Additionally, my commitment extends to Azm Youth, another NGO where I contribute my time and efforts. 
I am also proud to serve as a board member in our university's Astronomy Club, where I support students in exploring the wonders of the cosmos.
Furthermore, as a board member responsible for public relations in GDSC, I collaborate with a dynamic team to promote technology and development in our local community. 
My journey revolves around creating positive change and fostering growth in various facets of society.
